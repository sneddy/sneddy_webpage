    "The data science market in Kazakhstan has been actively developing over the past three years. During this period, there has been significant growth: large product, infrastructure, and research teams, as well as AI-driven startups, have emerged. Numerous meetups are being held, and our specialists are successfully participating in international competitions and producing interesting research projects.​",
    "It's encouraging that several universities have introduced specialized programs in data science, including master's programs at Nazarbayev University, KazNU, KBTU, Yessenov Data Lab at ALMA University, and Astana IT University. However, there remains a noticeable shortage of middle and senior specialists, as well as individuals with experience in leading data science companies. In the coming years, I anticipate even stronger competition for talent in the field of data analysis, especially in the banking sector."
